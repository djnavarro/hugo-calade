```

The "hugo-slum" repository is a Hugo theme designed for R users, which can be installed using the [slumdown](https://github.com/djnavarro/slumdown) package. The example site serves both as an illustration of what slumdown sites look like and a tutorial in how to use the theme:

https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/

The simplest way to get started with the slum theme is to download the slumdown R package from GitHub using the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("djnavarro/slumdown")
```

Once the slumdown package is installed, the tutorial in the [posts](https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/post/) section of the example site will walk you through the rest of the process.
