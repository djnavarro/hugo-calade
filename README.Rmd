The "hugo-calade" repository is a Hugo theme designed for R users, which can be installed using the [caladown](https://github.com/djnavarro/caladown) package. The example site serves both as an illustration of what caladown sites look like and a tutorial in how to use the theme:

https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-calade/

The simplest way to get started with the calade theme is to download the caladown R package from GitHub using the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("djnavarro/caladown")
```

Once the caladown package is installed, the tutorial in the [posts](https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-calade/post/) section of the example site will walk you through the rest of the process.
