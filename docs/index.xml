      <description>The aim of caladown is to provide a simple Hugo template suitable for R users who want to build a website or start a blog, and is designed to be compatible with both blogdown and hugodown. In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to get started. The assumed reader for this tutorial is an R user who has some experience with R Markdown, but is unfamiliar with blogdown, hugodown, or Hugo itself.</description>

I donâ€™t want to have to edit with low level settings to do that. In the second part of the tutorial I discuss this kind of customisation.</description>

      <description>The usual advice for deploying a blogdown or hugodown site is to deploy to Netlify rather than GitHub Pages, because there are a few peculiarities to GitHub Pages that can make it difficult. The third part of the tutorial walks you through both versions.</description>

      <description>An example of a project page, creating a simple generative art system in R. There is more code on this page than elsewhere on the example site, which may be useful if you want to see what the syntax highlighting looks like for caladown sites.</description>
