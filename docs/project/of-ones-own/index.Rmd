Projects are no different to blog posts in caladown. They're formatted the same way, generated the same way, and so on. The only difference is that they're indexed separately. This is sometimes useful for separating casual blog posts from more substantive projects. 


In this post I'll create a simple generative art system... TODO: design a system that doesn't require additional dependencies!
