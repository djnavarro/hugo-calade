The usual advice for deploying a blogdown or hugodown site is to deploy to Netlify rather than GitHub Pages, because there are a few peculiarities to GitHub Pages that can make it difficult. The third part of the tutorial walks you through both versions, or to be more precise, it will walk you through both versions once I familiarise myself with Netlify and various other things. For the moment, only the GitHub Pages version is documented here.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The way I set up all my static websites is through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and I've tried to arrange things so that this is as simple as possible. However, it's not quite a point-and-click process and there are a few things you need to consider. 

The first thing to think about is the URL. If the home page for the site is a domain or a subdomain, then you shouldn't need to edit anything. For example, if the URL will be something like the following you're fine:
```
https://username.github.io/
https://my-slumdown-site.com/
https://site.my-webpage.com/
```

However, it is not uncommon for people to deploy a site to a folder within a domain. This happens a lot on GitHub Pages. Suppose the name of your GitHub repo is `my-slumdown-site` and you'd like it to deploy to its own GitHub Pages site. By default the URL for it will be something like this:

```
https://username.github.io/my-slumdown-site/
```

If this is situation, your Hugo configuration file needs to specify the name of the deployment folder. To do this, open the `config.toml` file, and find the line that currently says:
```
baseurl = "/"
```
Edit this to refer to your repository name, like this:
```
baseurl = "/my-slumdown-site/"
```

The second thing you need to do is make sure that Hugo is writing your static site to the `docs` folder. Depending on what command you typed in to create your site, this might already be done for you. However, if it is not (for example, if your site has a `public` folder but no `docs` folder), then what you will need to do is open the `config.toml` line and find the `publishDir = ` line. Edit that line so that it reads as follows:
```
publishDir = "docs"
```
Note that you may need to rebuild your site after doing this. 

At this point you are ready to deploy! If you haven't already done so, initialise a git repository in your project and then push it to GitHub. The laziest way I know of to do this is with the following R commands:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github()
```
On GitHub, go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the section entitled "GitHub Pages". There should be a drop down menu underneath the subheading "Source". Click on it and select "master branch /docs folder". 

And that's it! The site should now deploy.
