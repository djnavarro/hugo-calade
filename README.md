# SLURM: A slightly less unremittingly minimal theme for Hugo and blogdown

**SLURM** is a Hugo theme that adapts the **Xmin** theme. The goal here is to make sure I understand the basics of how Hugo works. 

```
blogdown::new_site(
  dir = here::here("testSite"), 
  theme = "djnavarro/hugo-slurm")
)
```
