SLURM
================

**slurm** is a Hugo theme that adapts the **Xmin** theme. The original
theme is intended to be e**X**tremely **MIN**imal. This extension is an
attempt to be **S**lightly **L**ess **U**n**R**emittingly **M**inimal.
My main goal though was to make sure I understand the basics of how Hugo
works.

## Note to self

To create the example site using the SLURM template into a fresh
directory:

``` r
blogdown::new_site(
  dir = here::here("testSite"), 
  theme = "djnavarro/hugo-slurm")
)
```
