# What format should the permalinks take? In the example site there
# are two kinds of pages, posts and projects, listed at:
#
#    https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/post/
#    https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/project/
#
# Each post is then followed by its own "slug", so the full path
# might be something like this:
#
#     https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/post/getting-started/
#
[permalinks]
    post = "/post/:slug/"
    project = "/project/:slug/"
#
# Alternative version:
#   post = "/post/:year/:month/:day/:slug/"
#   project = "/project/:year/:month/:day/:slug/"



# These settings are used to specify the links in the main
# navigation bar. Each item has a "name" (the link text), a
# "url" (path to the page), and a "weight" (the order).
# Something to keep in mind for new users: you won't find
# specific files that correspond to all of these pages. See
# the documentation for an explanation of where they come from
