**TODO**. Talk about the templating system. Why is this page in "projects" and everything else is in "posts". It's actually super customisable, you can just create your own folders!

- `_default/single.html`: the specific posts and project pages (in content)
- `_default/lists.html` : the "listing pages" for posts and projects (auto)
- `_default/terms.html` : the "listing page" for tags (auto)
- `_default/home.html` : the home page (corresponding to _index.html)

The exception is:

- `generic_page/single.html` : used in the about.html page (note the YAML)

Each of these uses various "partial" templates to avoid code reuse. 

If you ever want to customise layouts, you can use the layouts folder rather than try to edit the themes folder.
