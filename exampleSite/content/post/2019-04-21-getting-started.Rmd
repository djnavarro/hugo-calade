```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

My initial goal in writing the *slum* theme was purely selfish: I use blogdown on [my own blog](https://djnavarro.net) and I wanted to understand how it works. To help me learn, I decided to [read the documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and tinker with the minimalistic [XMin theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin). I... um... got a little carried away, and ended up with a fairly flexible blogging template with a few more bells and whistles than I was expecting. I wasn't entirely convinced it would be useful, so I named it *Somewhat-Light Unhelpfully-Minimal* Hugo theme. 

Having created the thing, I decided I might as well document it too...

My assumption is that anyone intending to use the *slum* theme is using it within blogdown rather than some other kind of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website, so the documentation is written with an R user in mind. Additionally, I'll assume that you've never used blogdown or Hugo before, but I do assume you've used [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

EXAMPLES WITH BLOGDOWN AND HUGODOWN

Blogdown will then generate the [example site](https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/) in the `docs` folder, which provides a short tutorial on how to get started using the package and what it is capable of. 



## Initial configuration

Most of the settings that you'll initially want to play with are in the `config.toml` file. The file is (I hope) fairly well documented, so you can see what most of the settings do and how to configure them. For example, here's
a snippet:

```
# These settings specify the title for your blog, 
# and the name of the Hugo theme that it uses.
title = "A minimal Hugo website"
theme = "hugo-slum"
```

Take a look at the config file, change a couple of things if you like, and then you're ready to start blogging!
