```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Here is some text that I have written. This page uses the light theme. The background colour for this theme is very slightly grey rather than white, so if you want a plot to blend in with the background you need to do something like this:

```{r scatter, fig.cap = "Here is a plot", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
source(here::here("scripts","theme_slum.R"))

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_slum("light")
```
