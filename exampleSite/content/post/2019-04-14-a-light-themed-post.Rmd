theme_slum <- function(palette = "dark", ...) {

  if(palette == "dark") {
    primary <- "#DDDDDD"

  theme_grey(...) %+replace%
    theme(
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = behind, colour = behind),
      panel.background = element_rect(fill = subtle, colour = subtle),
      legend.background = element_rect(fill = behind, colour = behind),
      plot.title = element_text(colour = primary),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = primary),
      axis.title = element_text(colour = primary),
      axis.text = element_text(colour = primary),
      legend.title = element_text(colour = primary),
      legend.text = element_text(colour = primary)
    )
}
```

Here is some text that I have written. This page uses the light theme. The background colour for this theme is very slightly grey rather than white, so if you want a plot to blend in with the background you need to do something like this:

```{r scatter, fig.cap = "Here is a plot", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_slum("light")
```

The theme function is bundled in a script contained in the static directory. However, if we want to source the file, it's important to realise that at the
time at which the R Markdown is compiled, this is the working directory:

```{r}
getwd()
```
