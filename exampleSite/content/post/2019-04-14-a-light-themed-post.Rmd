Here is some text that I have written. This page uses the light theme. To make
life a little easier the theme includes an R scrupt that supplies ggplot2 themes.
The theme function is bundled in a script contained in the static directory. However, if we want to source the file, it's important to realise that at the
time at which the R Markdown is compiled, this is the working directory:

```{r}
getwd()
```

To source the script, we need this:

```{r}
source(file.path(
  "..","..","static","scripts","theme_slum.R"
))
```

The background colour for this theme is very slightly grey rather than white, so if you want a plot to blend in with the background you need to do something like this:

```{r scatter, fig.cap = "Here is a plot", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_slum("light")
```
