```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

Here is some text that I have written. This page uses the light theme. To make life a little easier I've also written a small package that supplies ggplot2 themes that are consistent with the slum styles:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("djnavarro/slumstyle")
library(slumstyle)
library(tidyverse)
```

The background colour for this theme is very slightly grey rather than white, so if you want a plot to blend in with the background you need to do something like this:

```{r scatter, fig.cap = "Here is a plot", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_slum("light")
```
