```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

The usual advice with blogdown is to deploy to netlify because it makes a few things easier than doing it with GitHub pages. Naturally, I just have to do things the hard way...

- The `.nojekyll` file is needed
- The baseurl in the `config.toml` file is needed
- Managing the tension between public and docs.
