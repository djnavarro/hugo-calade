The *slum* provides a simple Hugo theme intended primarily to be used in conjunction with the *blogdown* package, so posts take the form of R Markdown documents rather than plain markdown. I'm fairly certain that the theme supports plain markdown, but given that the appeal of *blogdown* lies in integrating R Markdown with the Hugo blogging system I'll jump straight to it. 

## 1. The YAML header

Like any R Markdown document, a post begins with the YAML header. For this post, the header looks like this:

```

```
Note that I specified the post summary manually. If you don't do it yourself, the template will set one for you but it won't look very nice.


## 2. R chunks

As usual, R chunks can be inserted:

```{r packageload, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(slumdown)
```

Code that produces console output renders like this:

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```


## 3. Theme-consistent plots

Because *slum* was written with the *blogdown* user in mind, the accompanying *slumstyle* package allows a modest amount of integration between the R side to the blog and the Hugo side. At the moment this is limited to providing a `theme_slum()` function for styling ggplot2 output. For instance, this site uses the "dark" colour theme, as specified by the following line in the `config.toml` file:

```
colourScheme = "css/colour_dark.css"
```

To create ggplot output that mirrors this theme, make sure that the [slumstyle package](https://github.com/djnavarro/slumstyle) is loaded and then it is as simple as specifying `theme_slum(dark)`, as shown in  Figure \@ref(fig:scatter) below:

```{r scatter, fig.cap = "Here is a plot", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_slum("dark")
```

By default the *slum* theme provides this "dark" colour scheme, but there is also a "light" scheme and a "kunoichi" scheme. I'll talk more about colour schemes in the next post.

## 4. LaTeX

Inline LaTeX expressions look like this:

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`


## 5. Other markdown 

At the moment, blockquotes look like this:

> One is the loneliest number that you ever knew <br>
> Two can be as bad as one, it's the loneliest number since the number one

It's not the prettiest output ever and I might change it.
