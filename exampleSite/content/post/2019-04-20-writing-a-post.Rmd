```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

## 0 Create a new post

In blogdown:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_post(title = "My new post")
```

In hugodown:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hugodown::use_post(path = "post/my-new-post")
```

## 1. The YAML header

Like any R Markdown document, a post begins with the YAML header. For this post, the header looks like this:

```
---
title: "Tutorial part 2: Writing a post"
author: "Danielle Navarro"
date: "2019-04-13"
slug: writing-a-post
tags: ["slum", "blogdown", "slumstyle"]
summary: "Like any blogdown post, a slumdown post is written in R Markdown, and uses a few custom fields in the YAML field. This tutorial provides an illustration of how different kinds of content are displayed."
header:
  caption: "A blank ggplot"
  image: 'header/theme_dark.png'
---
```

Note that I specified the post summary manually. If you don't do it yourself, the template will set one for you but it won't look very nice.

In hugodown you should see an additional line: `output: hugodown::md_document`


## 2. R chunks

As usual, R chunks can be inserted:

```{r packageload, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#library(slumdown)
```

Code that produces console output renders like this:

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```

## 4. LaTeX

Inline LaTeX expressions look like this:

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`


## 5. Other markdown 

At the moment, blockquotes look like this:

> One is the loneliest number that you ever knew <br>
> Two can be as bad as one, it's the loneliest number since the number one
