```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

Here is some text that I have written. This page uses the light theme. To make life a little easier I've also written a small package that supplies ggplot2 themes that are consistent with the slum styles:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("djnavarro/slumstyle")
library(slumdown)
library(tidyverse)
```

The background colour for this theme is very slightly grey rather than white, so if you want a plot to blend in with the background you need to do something like this:

```{r scatter, fig.cap = "Here is a plot", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_slum("light")
```


## The CSS file

If you ever feel the need to do so, it's not too difficult to create a new colour scheme. The `static/css/colour_dark.css` file specifies the four main colours used:

```
:root {
  --primary: #ddd;
  --subtle: #888;
  --behind: #333;
  --highlight: hotpink;
}
```


## Changing the header image

blah blah blahs
