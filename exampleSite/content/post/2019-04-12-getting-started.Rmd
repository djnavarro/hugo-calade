```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

My initial goal in writing the *slum* theme was purely selfish: I use blogdown on [my own blog](https://djnavarro.net) and I wanted to understand how it works. To help me learn, I decided to [read the documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and tinker with the minimalistic [XMin theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin). I... um... got a little carried away, and ended up with a fairly flexible blogging template with a few more bells and whistles than I was expecting. I wasn't entirely convinced it would be useful, so I named it *Somewhat-Light Unhelpfully-Minimal* Hugo theme. 

Having created the thing, I decided I might as well document it too...

My assumption is that anyone intending to use the *slum* theme is using it within blogdown rather than some other kind of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website, so the documentation is written with an R user in mind. Additionally, I'll assume that you've never used blogdown or Hugo before, but I do assume you've used [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).


## Step 1: Install slumstyle


The *slum* theme allows some degree of flexibility in visual styling, which is really nice when blogging. One thing that causes me frustration sometimes is that when I generate a plot within blogdown, the visual style of the plot doesn't align nicely with the style of the blog. To remedy that, I wrote a small package called *slumstyle* that will let you draw plots that match the theme. So let's install that first:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djnavarro/slumstyle")
```


## Step 2: Install blogdown

Next, you need to make sure you have the blogdown package installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("blogdown")
```

## Step 3: Create a slum-themed blog

Once you have blogdown installed, the next step is to install the *slum* theme and download this webpage as a starter blog. I'll assume that you have somewhere sensible in mind to install it:

```{r}
bloghome <- "~/../Desktop/slum"
```

The command to create a new site is:

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(
  dir = bloghome, 
  theme = "djnavarro/hugo-slum",
  theme_example = TRUE,
  sample = FALSE
)
```

In this example, we're doing a few things:

- The `dir` argument tells blogdown where to create the blog on the local machine
- The `theme` argument tells blogdown what Hugo theme to use, and in this case it will fetch everything from the [slum github repository](https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-slum)
- By setting `theme_example = TRUE` blogdown also downloads the files for the example website (i.e., this site) in addition to the theme files themselves
- By setting `sample = FALSE` blogdown ignores the starter posts that Hugo tries to insert. 

At any later point in time:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd(bloghome)
blogdown::serve_site()
```


## Step 4: initial configuration

Most of the settings that you'll initially want to play with are in the `config.toml` file. The file is (I hope) fairly well documented, so you can see what most of the settings do and how to configure them. For example, here's
a snippet:

```
# These settings specify the title for your blog, 
# and the name of the Hugo theme that it uses.
title = "A minimal Hugo website"
theme = "hugo-slum"
```

Take a look at the config file, change a couple of things if you like, and then you're ready to start blogging!
