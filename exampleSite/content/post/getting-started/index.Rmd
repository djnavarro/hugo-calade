The aim of [slum](https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-slum) is to provide a simple Hugo template suitable for R users who want to build a website or start a blog, and is designed to be compatible with both [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [hugodown](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown). In this tutorial, I'll show you how to get started. The assumed reader for this tutorial is an R user who has some experience with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), but is unfamiliar with blogdown, hugodown, or Hugo itself.


## Blogdown or Hugodown?

The first decision you need to make is which R package to use, blogdown or hugodown? Both allow you to design and manage static websites within R, and both allow you to write pages/posts as R markdown documents. However, there are differences: blogdown blurs the roles played by Hugo  and R, which can lead to some degree of messiness. In contrast, hugodown tries to maintain a clean separation: the role of hugodown is to translate your R markdown files into a "plain" markdown format that Hugo knows how to read, and then leaves the rest of the process to Hugo. To me, the cleaner separation in hugodown is highly desirable: but it is currently an experimental package, so some caution is warranted!

If you want to use blogdown, you can create a new site with the following command. Just change `"path_to_blog_folder"` to something suitable: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(
  dir = "path_to_blog_folder", 
  theme = "djnavarro/hugo-slum", 
  theme_example = TRUE,
  sample = FALSE)
```

Blogdown will download the slum template and generate the example site (i.e., this one!) in the `docs` folder, and you are ready to get started. 
If you want to use hugodown, you can create a new site using the following command: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hugodown::create_site_slum("path_to_blog_folder")
```

When you do this, hugodown will download the slum template and configure the site appropriately. To build the site:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lapply(hugodown::site_outdated(), rmarkdown::render)
hugodown::hugo_build()
hugodown::hugo_start()
```

I suspect this is not the optimal way to do things, but it works and at this point you should have the website in the `docs` folder.

## Initial configuration

Most of the settings that you'll initially want to play with are in the `config.toml` file. The file is (I hope) fairly well documented, so you can see what most of the settings do and how to configure them. For example, here's a snippet:

```
# These settings specify the title for your blog, 
# and the name of the Hugo theme that it uses.
title = "A minimal Hugo website"
theme = "slum"
```

The snippet above is what you should see if you are using hugodown. If you are using blogdown it will be slightly different: the theme folder will have been automatically renamed from `"slum"` to `"hugo-slum"`, and this will be reflected in the `config.toml` file. Either way, take a look at the config file, change a couple of things if you like, and then you're ready to start blogging!

## Your first post

Creating posts or pages is (usually) pretty straightfoward in both blogdown and hugodown. In blogdown, you can use the `new_post()` function to create a post, and all you need to do is specify the title:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_post(title = "My new post")
```

Given that information, blogdown can take care of low level things like constructing the path and so on. 

In hugodown, the `use_post()` function is similar but not quite identical. The main thing you need to do is specify the `path` that you'd like the new page to have. So if I want my website to create a page at `https://myfancywebsite.com/post/my-new-post` or whatever, the command I would need is this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hugodown::use_post(path = "post/my-new-post")
```

Either way, whether you are using blogdown or hugodown, you should now be looking at a new R markdown document that you can start editing!
