summary: "The main reason I wrote slumdown (besides boredom) was to make it easy to  include user-defined colours palettes in blogdown, and expose those palettes to R so that (for instance) plots can be drawn in a style that matches the blog style. This tutorial introduces this palette system."

The *slum* theme for Hugo allows some degree of flexibility in visual styling, which is really nice when blogging. Most of the time I want my blog to use a consistent palette, but then there are occasions where I might want a single page to use a different colour scheme, and I don't want to have to fiddle with low level settings to do that. Relatedly, one thing that has caused me frustration with blogdown is that the content generated on the R site doesn't use the same visual style as the Hugo theme. The `slumdown` package tries to make this a little easier. For this blog, the default colour scheme is based on the *dark* palette. The following palettes are available by default:


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
slumdown::slum_palette_paths()
```

A palette is not especially complicated, and is defined by a set of five named colours:

```{r}
slumdown::slum_palette("dark")
```

When creating a new post or project page, the *slum* theme for Hugo will automatically use the default palette (which is specified in the `config.toml` file). However, you can override that default for a specific post. For example, the current post uses the *light* palette, and it does this by including the following line in the YAML header:

```
colourscheme: "css/palette_light.css"
```

The palette file is quite small and if you felt the need to do so, you could create one manually. For example, here is the entirety of the `static/css/palette_light.css` file:

```
/* light colour scheme */
:root {
  --pagecolour: #eeeeee;
  --maintext: #111111;
  --faded: #999999;
  --highlight: #0000dd;
  --lowlight: #8a2be2;
}
```

However the `slumdown` package attempts to make your life a little easier by providing a helper function that will generate a palette file for you. For example, suppose I wanted to create a new palette based on Emi Tanaka's [kunoichi template for xaringan](https://yihui.name/en/2018/07/emi-tanaka/). I could to that as follows:

```{r}
slumdown::slum_palette_create(
  name = "kunoichi", pagecolour = "#562457", 
  maintext = "#ffffff", faded = "#ba68c8", 
  highlight = "#ffa500", lowlight = "#bbbbbb",
  overwrite = TRUE)
```

Note that this function isn't flexible. It does no preprocessing or conversion of the colour input, and as such expects something that is understood by both R and CSS. Hex codes work fine, other things not so much.

The nice thing about the palettes in the *slum* theme is that the functions in the *slumdown* package are aware of them, and make them available to other R functions. To give an example of how this can be done, the `slumdown` package provides the function `theme_slum()` which allows you to create a plot like this: 

```{r scatter}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_slum("light")
```

The `theme_slum()` function will only work if it can find the relevant palette file (not surprisingly), and it relies on `here::here()` to find them, so it is important that a slumdown blog correspond to an RStudio project, or else contain a blank text file called `.here` at the project root. 

This is slightly tedious, but the advantage is that you can generate plots that match your own themes with very little effort. For example, the *kunoichi* palette that I created above is now immediately available for plotting: 

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_slum("kunoichi")
```

So if you wanted to do a single post in the *kunoichi* style, you could now specify the colour scheme in the YAML header, and create ggplot2 figures that adopt this style.
