summary: "The main reason I wrote slumdown (besides boredom) was to make it easy to  include user-defined colours palettes in blogdown, and expose those palettes to R so that (for instance) plots can be drawn in a style that matches the blog style. This tutorial introduces this palette system."

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```



The *slum* theme for Hugo allows some degree of flexibility in visual styling, which is really nice when blogging. Most of the time I want my blog to use a consistent palette, but then there are occasions where I might want a single page to use a different colour scheme, and I don't want to have to fiddle with low level settings to do that. Relatedly, one thing that has caused me frustration with blogdown is that the content generated on the R site doesn't use the same visual style as the Hugo theme. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() 
```

This doesn't look *too* terrible but the white background is jarring. You can fix this with the thematic package:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(thematic)
thematic_on(bg = "#eeeeee")
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() 
```
