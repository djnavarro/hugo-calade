The usual advice for deploying a blogdown or hugodown site is to deploy to Netlify rather than GitHub Pages, because there are a few peculiarities to GitHub Pages that can make it difficult. The third part of the tutorial walks you through both versions.


## Deploying to GitHub Pages

I have an ingrained habit of using GitHub Pages, so I'll start with this. Suppose the name of your GitHub repo is `my-slumdown-site` and you'd like it to deploy to a GitHub Pages site located at:
```
https://username.github.io/my-slumdown-site/
```

To make that happen for a blogdown site there are three things you need to change from the usual defaults:

**First**, the site needs to be generated in the `docs` folder (which is what GitHub Pages expects) rather than the Hugo default which is to generate the site in the `public` folder. You can configure this by including the following line in the `config.toml` file:
```
publishDir = "docs"
```

**Second**, the generated `docs` folder needs to contain a blank text file called `.nojekyll`, otherwise GitHub Pages will try to treat your content as a Jekyll blog and it won't deploy correctly. The easiest way to do this is to make sure that the `.nojekyll` file is in the `static` folder, which will ensure that every time blogdown re-generates the `docs` folder the `.nojekyll` file will be copied across with it. 

**Third**, if you want the site to be hosted at a specific location (i.e., `https://username.github.io/reponame/` rather than `https://username.github.io/`), Hugo needs to know what `reponame` is, otherwise the paths to various files will break when the site deploys. To do this, there is a line in the `config.toml` file that (by default) reads as follows:
```
baseurl = "/"
```
Edit this to refer to your repository name. For instance:
```
baseurl = "/my-slumdown-site/"
```

At this point you can, set up the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site the way you normally would.
