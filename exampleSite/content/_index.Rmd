# Slurm theme for Hugo

My goal in writing *slurm* is to provide minimal Hugo theme based on Yihui Xie's *Xmin* template. The name for the original theme reflects the fact that it is as "extremely minimal" theme; this extension is a "slightly less unremittingly minimal" theme. In truth though the main goal was to see if I understand the basics of CSS and Hugo. 


```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(mpg)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() 
```

Inline LaTeX expressions:

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme.
