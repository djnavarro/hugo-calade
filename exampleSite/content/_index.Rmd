The goal of calade and caladown is to allow R users to create lightweight websites powered by Hugo and is designed to be compatible with both [hugodown](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/) and [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), and allows users to generate graphics that match the visual style of the site via the [thematic](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/) package. There are two components to caladown, a [Hugo theme](https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-calade) and an [R package](https://github.com/djnavarro/caladown). The simplest way to get started is simply to download the R package from GitHub using the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("djnavarro/caladown")
```

Once the caladown package is installed, the tutorial in the [posts](/post/) section of this site will walk you through the rest of the process. For folks who already know what they are doing, here's the quick guide to setting up a Hugodown site on GitHub Pages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
caladown::create_hugodown_calade("my-caladown-site")
hugodown::hugo_build(dest = "docs")
usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github() # then enable GH Pages with /docs folder
```
