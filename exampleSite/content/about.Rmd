# About the slum theme

The slum theme for Hugo and blogdown is an adaptation Yihue Xie’s Xmin theme that borrows stylistic elements from the Tufte R Markdown theme and from the academic Hugo theme. I’m not really convinced it’s useful for much, hence the name; this is a somewhat-light unhelpfully-minimal Hugo theme. In truth, my main goal in putting this theme together was to make sure I understand the basics of how Hugo works.

> One is the loneliest number that you ever knew <br>
> Two can be as bad as one, it's the loneliest number since the number one

## Examples

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point() 
```

Inline LaTeX expressions:

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`
