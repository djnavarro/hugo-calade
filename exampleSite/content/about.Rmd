# The slum theme for blogdown

The slum theme for Hugo and blogdown is an adaptation Yihue Xieâ€™s Xmin theme that borrows stylistic elements from the Tufte R Markdown theme and from the academic Hugo theme. Originally it was intended to be extremely minimal, with the very modest goal of trying to make sure I understood the logic of how Hugo generates static sites. The more I played with it though, the more I enjoyed it. So what I've ended up with is a *"somewhat-light unhelpfully-minimal"* Hugo theme, designed with a single goal in mind: eventually I'm going to use it as the theme for [my blog](https://djnavarro.net)
