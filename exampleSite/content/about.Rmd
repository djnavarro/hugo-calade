# About the package

The underlying Hugo theme was originally adapted from Yihue Xie's "Xmin" theme, but also borrows stylistic elements from the Tufte R Markdown theme. Some aspects to the theme were inspired by the "academic" Hugo theme, but it is considerably simpler. The original goal was for the site to be extremely minimal: I wrote it with the modest goal of teaching myself about how Hugo generates static sites. Over time, however, I realised I had a useful little tool. So I decided to call it *calade*, a "somewhat light, usefully minimal" website generator.
